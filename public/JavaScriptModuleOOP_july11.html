<!-- Javascript OOP
- Real world project development uses various programming systems
    1. POPS (Process Oriented Programming System)
    2. OBPS (Object Based Programming System)
    3. OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System)

POPS
- It supports low level features
- It can directly interact with hardware
- It is faster
- It is less memory
Ex:    C, Pascal, COBOL
- Reusability Issues
- Extensibility Issues
- Dynamic memory

OBPS
- It supports reusability
- It supports dynamic memory
- Limited extensibility
- Not loosely coupled.
- More memory than POPS
- Security Issues
Ex: JavaScript, VB

OOPS
- Reusability
- Security
- Extensibility
- Can't directly interact with hardware
- Slow
- More memory

Ex: C++, Java, .NET Language, TypeScript etc..


Note: JavaScript is not an OOP language. It supports only few feature of OOP.

History of OOP
- Alan Kay  in early 1960's introduced the concept of "Object" into computer programming.
- 1967  Johan Olay, Kristan Nygaard developed first OOP language "SIMULA"
   [Code Reusability]
            SIMULA 67
           
- Trygve introduced the concept of code separation. He introduced a framework called "MVC" [Model - View - Controller]

            Small Talk

- In early 1975 - C++
- In early 1990 - Java
- In early 2003 - .NET Language , TypeScript


                                   JavaScript Modules
- A module is a set of functions, values and classes.
- Module resemble a library for building application.
- JavaScript uses various module systems
    a) Common JS
    b) Require JS
    c) UMD (Universal Module Distribution)
    d) AMD (Asynchronous Module Distribution)

- By default with node.js you will get "Common JS" module system.

- Every JavaScript file is a module.
- Module comprises of functions, variables and classes.
- Every member in a module is accessible only within the module.
- If you want a function of class to be accessed outside module then you have to mark it as "export".

Syntax:
        export function Name(){ }
        export class Name() { }

- Every module can have one "default" member.
- Default member loads automatically

Syntax:
      export default function Name() { }

- You can import the member is a page by using "import " statement

     import  { function } from  '../library/module.js';        // non default members
     import  function from '../library/module.js';            // default member
     import  defaultFun, { function } from '../library/module.js';


- Modules are configured with type as "module"

    <script type="module"> </script>

EX:
1. Add a new folder "library"

2. Add a new JavaScript file into library

        "DemoModule.js"

var msg = "Hello ! Welcome to JavaScript OOP";
export function Hello(){
    return msg;
}
export default function Add(a, b)
{
    return a + b;
}

3. Go to your HTML page

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>JavaScript Modules</title>
        <script src="../library/DemoModule.js"></script>
        <script type="module">
            import Add, { Hello } from "../library/DemoModule.js";
            document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = Hello() + "<br>" + "Addition=" + Add(10,30);
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Module System</h2>
        <p></p>
    </body>
</html>
     
                                         Classes
- In OOP languages class is a program template.
- A template comprises of sample data and logic which you can customize according to your requirements and implement.
- Class is reffered as model when it is mapping with data.
- Class is reffered as entity when it is mapping with business.
- Class is a blue print for designing templates.
- In JavaScript OOP class can contain only
        a) Property
        b) Method
        c) Accessor
        d) Constructor -->
