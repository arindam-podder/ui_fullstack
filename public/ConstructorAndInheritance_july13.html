Design Patterns
- 23 GoF design patterns
    a) Creational
    b) Structrual
    c) Behavioural


                                Constructor
- Constructor is a software design pattern.
- It is a creational pattern.
- It is the process of creating an instance for class.
- Constructor is a special type of subroutine used for instantiation.
  [Creating Object].
- Every class have a default constructor.
- You can add a constructor explicitly.
- Constructor is a special type method [subroutine] that executes automatically at the time of creating object.
- JavaScript constructor is Anonymous type

Syntax:
    class  Name
    {
        constructor() { }
    }

    let obj = new Name;        Name()

- If constructor is parameterized then you have to mention about constructor at the time of instantiation.

- You have to pass values into constructor at the time of allocating memory for object.

        let obj = new Name(params);

Ex:
<head>
  <script>
     class Database
     {
        constructor(dbName){
            alert(`Connected with ${dbName} database successfully..`);
        }
        Insert(){
            document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "Record Inserted";
        }
        Delete(){
            document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "Record Deleted";
        }
     }
     function InsertClick(){
        let obj = new Database("Oracle");
        obj.Insert();
     }
     function DeleteClick(){
        let obj = new Database("MySql");
        obj.Delete();
     }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
    <button onclick="InsertClick()">Insert on Oracle</button>
    <button onclick="DeleteClick()">Delete from MySql</button>
    <p></p>
</body>

- JavaScript constructor can't overload.
- You can't restrict constructor.

Summary:
1. Property
2. Method
3. Accessor
4. Constructor

                        Code Reusability and Extensibility
- You can reuse and extend code by using 2 techniques
    a) Aggregation
    b) Inheritance

Aggregation:
- It is the process of access members of one class in another class without re-writing.
- It is the process of reusing without configuring any relation between class.
- It is often called as "Object-to-Object" communication.
- It is also known as "Has-A-Relation".

Ex:
<script>
    class Base
    {
        Print(){
            document.write("Base Class Print Method<br>");
        }
    }
    class Derived
    {
        Print(){
            let obj = new Base;
            obj.Print();
            document.write("Derived Class Print Method");
        }
    }
    let obj = new Derived;
    obj.Print();
</script>


Inheritance:
- It is the process that allows to access members of one class in another class without an object.
- You can configure relation between class.
- You can access the members of existing class in current class by using "extends".
- Current class can extend the existing class.
- Existing class is known as "Super" class.
- Current class in known as "Derived" class.
- You can access super class members in derived class by using "super" keyword.
- This process is reffered as "Is-A-Relation".

Ex:
<script>
    class Base
    {
        Print(){
            document.write("Base Class Print Method<br>");
        }
    }
    class Derived extends Base
    {
        Print(){
            super.Print();
            document.write("Derived Class Print Method");
        }
    }
    let obj = new Derived;
    obj.Print();
</script>

OOP Rules:
 - When you create an object for derived class which is extending super class, then as per OOP rules first base class constructor is called and followed by derived class constructor.

- JavaScript will not follow the above rule.
- You have to explicitly design the derived class constructor that calls base class constructor.

Ex:
<script>
    class Base
    {
        constructor(){
            document.write("Base Class Constructor<br>");
        }
        Print(){
            document.write("Base Class Print Method<br>");
        }
    }
    class Derived extends Base
    {
        constructor(){
            super();
            document.write("Derived Class Constructor<br>");
        }
        Print(){
            super.Print();
            document.write("Derived Class Print Method");
        }
    }
    let obj = new Derived;
    obj.Print();
</script> -->
