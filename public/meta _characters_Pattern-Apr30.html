14. pattern      :  It is used to verify the format of input value.
           Pattern uses regular expression to verify
           the format of input value.

           Regular expression is built by using meta
           characters and quantifiers.


Meta Character    Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
?        zero or one occurance of char.

        Syntax:
        pattern="colou?r"    =>  color, colour

+        one or more occurances of char

        Syntax:
        pattern="colou+r"    => colour, colouur, colouuur
                   color - not allowed

*        zero or more occurances of char

        Syntax:
        pattern="colou*r"   => color, colour, colouur

.        Any single char [a-zA-Z0-9!@#$%^&]

        Syntax:
        pattern=".o."   => dos, toy, cow
        pattern=".at"   =>  cat, bat, rat, mat, $at, 1at
        pattern=".o.?"  =>  dos, boy, to, do  

|        OR - It is used to define multiple values or chars
                 you can choose between.

        Syntax:
        pattern="color|colour";
        pattern="red|green|blue|yellow"

\        It is used as escape sequence char for meta
        chars.
        Few meta characters are required to use as
        symbols in pattern. Hence "\" can escape the
        functionality of meta character and use it as         symbol.

        Syntax:
        pattern="gmail\.com"
        pattern="\+91"

^        Used in expression to exclude specified set of
        chars. It is also used to define pattern starts with.

        ^    exclude   [charat]
        \^    starts with

\$        It defines ends with. It is also used in expression.

[ ]        It defines range.

( )        It defines priority and union.

\d        It defines numeric, any number single digit.
       
        Syntax:

        pattern="\d\d" => 22, 45, any 2 digits number

\D        It defines non-numeric, other than number all are
