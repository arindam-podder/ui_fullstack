<!-- while loop
- It is used when we are not sure about the number of iterations.
- Iteration counter will change dynamically.
- It can start loop only when condition is true.

Syntax:
        while(condition)
        {
          counter;
          statements;
        }

Ex:
<script>
    var i = 1;
    while(i<=10)
    {
        document.write(i +"<br>");
        i++;
    }
</script>

                                do while
- It is similar to while loop but can execute statements at least once even when the condition is false.

Syntax:
 do
 {
    statement;
    counter;
 } while(condition);

Ex:
<script>
    var i = 21;
    do
    {
        document.write(i + "<br>");
        i++;
    }while(i<=20);
</script>

                        Exception Handling Statements

- In computer programming developers will come across 2 types of errors.
            1. Compile Time Errors
            2. Run Time Errors

- Compile time errors are syntax errors, due to which the program fails to compile and unable to print output.

- Runtime errors : Program is compiled successfully without errors.
                        When user interacts with program and provides
                        input which is not understandable to compiler
                        then it leads to run time errors.
   
                        If any runtime errors occurs in a program that leads
                        to abnormal termination.

- "Exception Handling is used in computer programming to avoid abnormal termination".

- Exception handling in JavaScript is managed by following statements

    try                - It is monitoring block : statement to execute
    catch            - It is handler block : It catches the exception
    throw            - It is used to throw the error.
    finally            - It contains statements to execute always.

Ex:
<script>
    try {
        var x = parseInt(prompt("Enter Number-1"));
        var y = parseInt(prompt("Enter Number-2"));
        var z = x / y;
        if(y==0) {
            throw "Divide By Zero Error: You can't divide by Zero";
        }
        if(y>x) {
            throw "Number too large: You have to provide a number lower than the previous."
        }
        document.write(`Division=${z}`);
    }
    catch(ex)
    {
        document.write(ex);
    }
    finally {
        alert("Program End");
    }
</script>

                              Functions in JavaScript

- Functions are used in computer programming for "Refactoring"
- Refactor is the process of extracting a function for set of statements so that you can reuse.
