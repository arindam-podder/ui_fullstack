<!-- JavaScript OOP
- Modules
- Class

                                    Class
- Class is a program template.
- Class have the behaviour of
        a) Model
        b) Entity
        c) Blue Print
- Class is reffered as model when it is mapping to data requirements.
- Class is reffered as entity when it is mapping to business requirements.
- Class is reffered as blue print when it is used as template.

How to define class?
- class is defined by using 2 techniques
        a) Class declaration
        b) Class expression

- Class declaration allows to configure class with a set of specific members.

Syntax:
         class className
        {
        }

- Class expression allows to configure memory for class where the class can change according state and situation.

Syntax:
        var name = class { };

Ex:
<script>
    //class declaration
    class Product
    {

    }
    //class expression
    var ProtoType = class {
        Name = "";
        Price = 0;
    }
    ProtoType = class {
        EmpName="";
        Designation="";
    }
</script>

- Every JavaScript class can contain only following members
        1. Property
        2. Method
        3. Accessor
        4. Constructor

FAQ: Can we define a variable in class?
Ans: No.

FAQ: Why variable is not allowed as class member?
Ans: Variable is immutable. Class can't contain immutable members.

FAQ: How data is stored in class?
Ans:  By using Property.

Syntax:
    class  Name
    {
        Property = value;
    }

FAQ: What is difference between Property and Variable?
Ans: Variable is immutable and property is mutable.

FAQ: Can we define a function in class?
Ans:  No.

FAQ: How functionality is defined in class?
Ans:  By using Method

- A class method can have variables and functions.

<script>
   class Product
   {
      Print(){
        var x = 10;
         function f1(){

         }
      }
   }
</script>

                                Class Members
1. Property
- It is used to store data.
- It is mutable
- It can store any type of data, Primitive or Non-Primitive.

<script>
   class Product
   {
      Name = "Samsung TV";
      Price = 45000.44;
      Stock = true;
      Cities = ["Delhi", "Hyd"];
      Rating = {Rate: 4, Count:6600}
   }
</script>

- You can access the class members by using instance of class.
- Instance is a object that refers to memory where all class members are loaded.

Syntax:
        let obj = new Product;
        obj.Name

Ex:
<script>
   class Product
   {
      Name = "Samsung TV";
      Price = 45000.44;
      Stock = true;
      Cities = ["Delhi", "Hyd"];
      Rating = {Rate: 4, Count:6600}
   }

   function PrintProductDetails()
   {
        let obj = new Product;
        document.write(`
        Name=${obj.Name}<br>
        Price=${obj.Price}<br>
        Stock=${obj.Stock}<br>
        Cities=${obj.Cities}<br>
        Rating=${obj.Rating.Rate}
        `);
   }
   PrintProductDetails();
</script>

- You can assign any value into property dynamically.

        let obj = new Product;
        obj.Name = "Samsung LED TV";



                                Accessor
- It is used to give a fine grained control over property.
- It can control read and write features for any property.
- Every property can have 2 accessors
        a) get            [getter used to read value from property]    
        b) set            [setter used to write value into property]


Ex:
<script>
    var username = prompt("Enter User Name");
    var role = prompt("Enter Your Role");
    var productname = prompt("Enter Product Name");

    class Product
    {
        _productName;

        get ProductName()
        {
            return this._productName;
        }
        set ProductName(newName){
            if(role=="admin") {
                this._productName = newName;
            } else {
                document.write("Unauthorized : You are not authorized to set product name");
            }
        }
    }
    let obj = new Product;
    obj.ProductName = productname;    
    if(obj.ProductName) {
        document.write(`Name=${obj.ProductName}`); // getter
    }
</script>

- You can also use accessor to access any member of class from a multi level hierarchy.

Ex:
<script>
    class Product
    {
        Name = "Nike Casuals";
        CustomerRating = {
            Rating : {
                Rate : 4.4,
                Count: 45000
            }
        }
        get CustomerRate(){
            return this.CustomerRating.Rating.Rate;
        }
    }
    let obj  = new Product;
    document.write(obj.CustomerRate);
</script>

                                 Method
- All method features are same as function
- Parameterized
- Parameter less
- Arrow
- Rest Parameters
- Recursion
- Return Type etc..

Syntax:
    {
      methodName(params)
      {
         // members... return type
      }
    }
