                    c) Logical Model
                    d) Entity Model

- Conceptual Model: It defines the list of modules that need data.
                           We have to prepare a list of modules that
                           require data.

- Physical Model    : It defines the table name, field name, data type
                          for every module.


- Logical Model        : It defines the relationship between module.


- Entity Model        : Entity Diagram [ER Diagram]
                            - table name

                            - relationship

 Conceptual Model => Physical Model => Logical Model => Entity Model => Database
